			"paragraph3": "We've felt that heartbreak. We've seen where the system falls short. And we built Legacy Concierge to be the answer. Our mission is simple yet sacred: to deliver elite, compassionate care that upholds dignity, trust, and humanity at every step. Every plan we design, every nurse we select, every partnership we form — all exist to ensure your loved one's journey is met with the reverence it deserves."

			"paragraph1": "Jason Kidushim, Founder and CEO of Legacy Concierge, created this company with one mission: to redefine what care feels like.",
			"paragraph2": "His inspiration began with his grandfather — a decorated war hero whose battle with Alzheimer's revealed the deep flaws in our healthcare system. Witnessing that loss of dignity became the catalyst for Jason's life's work: to build a service where no family would ever have to endure that kind of neglect again.",
			"paragraph3": "After returning to California, Jason united his decades of leadership in healthcare operations, patient advocacy, and service design to establish Legacy Concierge — a model that blends clinical precision with human connection.",
			"paragraph4": "Under his guidance, Legacy has become more than a care provider — it's a movement dedicated to preserving dignity, honoring family, and setting a new standard for home healthcare."
